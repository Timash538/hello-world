# hello-world

Hello, World! My name's Timur from Russia. I'm 23. I don't know what I'm doing here but I will!
Don't punch me for my english if it's bad, it'll make me sad. Better tell me how to improve my coding skills
(that I haven't:)) and english (if it's really hurts - to read my writings).
I read "Object-oriented programming in C++" by Robert Lafore, do exercises from book.
